Read the [SDK documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/%40azure%2Farm-compute_18.0.0/sdk/compute/arm-compute/README.md) on how to add the SDK to your project and authenticate.

```javascript
const { ComputeManagementClient } = require("@azure/arm-compute");
const { DefaultAzureCredential } = require("@azure/identity");
