/**
 * This sample demonstrates how to This operation retrieves a list of all the policy definitions in a given subscription that match the optional given $filter. Valid values for $filter are: 'atExactScope()', 'policyType -eq {value}' or 'category eq '{value}''. If $filter is not provided, the unfiltered list includes all policy definitions associated with the subscription, including those that apply directly or from management groups that contain the given subscription. If $filter=atExactScope() is provided, the returned list only includes all policy definitions that at the given subscription. If $filter='policyType -eq {value}' is provided, the returned list only includes all policy definitions whose type match the {value}. Possible policyType values are NotSpecified, BuiltIn, Custom, and Static. If $filter='category -eq {value}' is provided, the returned list only includes all policy definitions whose category match the {value}.
