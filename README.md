# Azure SDK examples for azure-rest-api-specs

This repository is the collection of Azure SDK examples corresponding to REST API examples from [Azure REST API Specifications](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs). SDK examples from this repository are integrated into the Azure REST API documentation pages on https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api for the corresponding operations.

Involved SDK repositories:
- [Azure SDK for Go](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go)
- [Azure SDK for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java)
- [Azure SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js)
- [Azure SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python)
- [Azure SDK for .Net](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net)

The repository is maintained by automated pipeline.

## Specification on filename

Mapping rule of filename from examples from azure-rest-api-specs to azure-rest-api-specs-examples.
1. Replace `/examples/` with language specific folder of `/examples-<language>/`.
2. - [Metadata](#metadata): The JSON file as metadata.
   - [Code snippet](#code-snippet): Replace `.json` with `.<language-ext>` in file extension.

Currently supported `language` includes:
- `go` for Go
- `java` for Java
- `js` for JavaScript
- `js-rlc` for JavaScript RLC (not displayed in the REST API documentation)
- `python` for Python
- `dotnet` for .NET
- `az` for Azure CLI

Pending:
- `ts` for typescript

### An instance of the mapping

For instance, JSON example in azure-rest-api-specs with filename
```
specification/datafactory/resource-manager/Microsoft.DataFactory/stable/2018-06-01/examples/DataFlows_Create.json
```
would map to code snippet (language=java) with filename
```
specification/datafactory/resource-manager/Microsoft.DataFactory/stable/2018-06-01/examples-java/DataFlows_Create.java
```
and metadata with filename
```
specification/datafactory/resource-manager/Microsoft.DataFactory/stable/2018-06-01/examples-java/DataFlows_Create.json
```
in azure-rest-api-specs-examples.

## File content

### Code snippet

Code snippet is runnable code in SDK language, as the SDK example.

Currently supported `language-ext` includes:
- `go` for Go
- `java` for Java
- `js` for JavaScript and JS-RLC (the latter is not displayed in the REST API documentation)
- `py` for Python
- `cs` for .NET
- `az` for Azure CLI

Pending:
- `ts` for typescript

### Metadata

Metadata is a JSON that contains information related to the code snippet.

----
| Property | Type | Required | Description
-|-|-|-
| sdkUrl | string | no | The URL to SDK documentation. It usually provides information on package and authentication.
| description | string | no | The description of the example.
----

### Cause of missing SDK examples

It is possible that for some api-version in some resource provider, there is no corresponding SDK example file, for some language.
Typical reason is that either the SDK of that language is not released, or the released SDK does not generate examples.

There is also possibility of missing a few SDK examples in a release.
Typical reason could be that SDK specifically removed a portion of the APIs, or the JSON example is considered not correct (e.g. some required parameter/property is not provided in JSON).
